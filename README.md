# Shock Lobster

Copyright 2021 Dave VanEe

Shock Lobster is a Game Boy ROM designed to run on the original Game Boy handheld
video game system using a flash cartridge. It should also play well on most
emulators.

Venture forth on your quest as a lowly lobster imbued with magical powers, 
determined to inflict lethal damage to whatever stands in your way!

You start out with a handful of skills allowing you to avoid oncoming obstacles 
and deal damage, but will use the pearls you collect on your way to unlock more 
skills, upgrades, and items to push your high score higher and higher.

This game is an entry for the [Game Boy Competition 2021](https://itch.io/jam/gbcompo21).

# Controls

## Loadout Controls

- D-Pad: Select item

- Start: Start game


## Battle Controls

- D-Pad: Select active button pair
- A/B: Use the corresponding skill from the current button pair

START.


# Gameplay Details

Press SELECT on the status screen to show detailed information about each 
skill, helping you decide how and when to best use the tools at your disposal 
for maximum output.

The A and B (X and Z) buttons are used to activate skills in combat, with the 
D-Pad used to select which pair of buttons is active. By default the selected 
pair will stick to the top pair when the D-Pad is released, but this can be 
disabled on the status screen. Skills may consume your energy, which is constantly
refilling, or generate charges, which are consumed by finishers which scale 
with the number of charges used.

Several of the skills apply damage-over-time effects to the enemy, time-limited 
buffs to yourself, or have cooldowns before they can be used again, which are 
represented by bars on the bottom-left of the game screen.

The game speed and loadout/items used will be summarized on the game over panel,
allowing you to compete with your friends to get the highest score using a specific
combination of skills and upgrades!

Note: If the game is running from a flash cart without SRAM, skills/upgrades/scores
will not be saved between sessions. To help with this, you can hold SELECT as you
start up the game to unlock all skills/upgrades.

# Change Log

### 2021-10-01 (ROM version: 1)

- Save new highscore/pearls when game is over, instead of when returning to the status screen, as it feels natural to power off at game over and you'd lose your progress before
- Change corners of SELECT tiles from color 2 to color 1 (lighter) to match START tiles
- Add DAS (delayed auto shift) to left/right cursor movement on status screen
- Fix a single frame visual glitch at the end of the bootup logo effect
